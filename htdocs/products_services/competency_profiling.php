                    <p>Competency profiling is an essential component of HR management. It identifies the competencies – skills, knowledge, attributes and attitudes – required for each job level or role to optimise your organisation’s performance.</p>

                    <p>Simply put, it provides you with a scientific framework to help ensure you deploy the right talent in the right role with the right responsibilities.</p>

                    <p>This framework is therefore key to the rest of your HR and <strong>talent management</strong> processes, guiding aspects such as recruitment and selection, training and development, <strong>performance management</strong>, as well as retention and succession planning.</p>
