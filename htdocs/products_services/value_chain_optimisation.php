                <div class='caption'>Unlocking benefits for all stakeholders</div>
                <div class='copy'>
                    <p>Today’s value chain optimisation is all about creating mutual benefit and often takes the form of a joint venture, strategic alliance or partnership.</p>

                    <p>OIM’s offering focuses on unlocking these benefits through relationship building and the implementation of robust performance management practices.</p>

                    <p>We assist organisations to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accurately define interfaces across the value chain.</li>
                            <li>Mutually agree on performance objectives and common values to deliver results.</li>
                            <li>Establish a methodology (INVOCOMS®) to effectively manage and improve the agreed performance objectives.</li> 
                            <li>Optimise business processes.</li>
                            <li>Regularly review performance and make improvements where required.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The result is a cost-effective and stable value chain with value sharing and an optimised risk-return equation.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Our offering</h2>
                    
                    <p>These results are available through our core offerings:

                            <li>A facilitated process to establish a framework for the value chain partnership.</li>
