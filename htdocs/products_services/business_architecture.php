                    <p>For your business strategy to succeed, the alignment of business structure, functional strategies and operating models is essential.</p>

                    <p>OIM’s business architecture offering helps organisations to achieve this alignment by developing and implementing a blue print for functional effectiveness, similar to an architect’s plan that shows the layout of a house down to the last detail. Our approach ensures that every aspect of your business structure is geared for functionality with clearly defined accountabilities, operating principles and flow of information for accurate decision making.<p> 

                    <h2>Our offering</h2>

                    <p>OIM’s <strong>business architecture</strong> offering <strong>aligns</strong> the following elements with your business strategy:
