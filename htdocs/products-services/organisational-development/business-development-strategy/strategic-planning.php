                    <p>At OIM we understand that the strategic planning and thinking process isn’t a once-off event. If you want to remain current and competitive you need continuous review and alignment.</p>

                    <p>We partner with organisations to help facilitate and establish this process. The outcome is:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>A well-planned strategy</strong>
                                <ul class="nested_ul">
                                    <li>Informed by sound research and debate.</li>
                                    <li>With clearly articulated implementation plans.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Internal capability </strong>
                                <ul class="nested_ul">
                                    <li>A method for ongoing reviews.</li>
                                    <li>A database that guides decision making.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <li>To ensure everyone in the organisations is engaged and focused on the performance goals and plays their part in strategy execution.</li>
                                <li>Relevant tools for communication and strategy implementation, eg business and functional scorecards.</li>

                    <h2>Our offering</h2>

                    <p>

                            <li>A comprehensive strategic planning intervention spanning about three months.</li>

                    <h2>The OIM difference</h2>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We do not believe in consultant dependency. Therefore sustainability, inclusivity and building internal capacity for the design, implementation and execution of strategy are key elements in our process.</li>
                            <li>An inherent part of this approach is the establishment of a framework for ongoing reviews.</li>
                            <li>We have successfully facilitated strategic planning interventions for a range of clients, many of whom still rely on our expertise to help facilitate workshops or interventions at critical junctures in their business journey.</li>
                            <li>OIM has also been leaders in the field of employee engagement (INVOCOM) since the early 80s with implementation in a range of industries and countries. INVOCOM is the execution methodology we establish at organisations as part of the strategic planning offering.</li>
                            <li>If required, clients also have access to the expertise embedded in the rest of OIM’s specialist areas, namely organisational performance improvement, operational optimisation and people management.</li> 
                        </ul>
