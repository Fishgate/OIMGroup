                    <p><strong>An operations review is a quick, reliable way to identify areas of operational constraint and map a solution.</strong></p>

                    <p>OIM’s operations management consultants have developed a proven approach to conduct this review in <strong>two to four weeks</strong>. This approach has been successfully applied at numerous businesses and in several sectors since 1996.</p>

                    <h2>Our offering</h2>

                    <p>The short review analyses areas such as productivity, process unit costs, quality levels, waste and the impact of machine and labour downtime. It consists of three phases:</p>

                    <p>Once the review has been completed, OIM presents the results, highlights the areas for improvement, recommends actions to address them and submits projected cost benefits.</p>
