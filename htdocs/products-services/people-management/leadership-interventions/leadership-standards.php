                <h1>Leadership Standards</h1>
                <div class='caption'>Establish the standard for successful leadership</div>
                <div class='copy'>
                    <p>Leaders are the undeniable drivers of your organisational culture and <strong>strategy implementation</strong>. Their behaviour and practices largely determine a business’ success or failure.</p>

                    <p>OIM helps organisations to set out leadership standards that are in line with their business strategy.</p> 

                    <p>After more than 25 years’ experience in business <strong>performance management</strong> we have concluded that the following leadership capabilities are required for a high-performing organisational culture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create shared purpose and direction
                            <li>Establish functional alignment and focus</li>
                            <li>Build credibility and the right climate</li>
                            <li>Facilitate stakeholder engagement</li>
                            <li>Enable continuous improvement</li>
                            <li>Facilitate measurement and feedback</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <strong>Manage leadership in an integrated way</strong><br/>
                    Leadership standards cannot be defined or implemented in isolation. They form part of a larger organisational performance initiative and serve as a foundation for the integrated management of <strong>leadership development</strong>, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Competency profiling:</strong> Use the standards framework to define the <strong>leadership skills</strong>, competencies, knowledge, attributes and attitudes required for each level.</li> 
                            [link to competency profiling]
                            <li><strong>Leadership assessments:</strong> Gain a more accurate picture of your leaders’ aptitudes, behavioural preferences, work styles, cultural fit and potential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leadership development:</strong> Use the competency profile and assessment outcomes as a basis for organisational and individual leadership development plans. This is a valuable performance tool to develop leaders in critical areas for business success.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coaching:</strong> Where required, use one-on-one sessions to help leaders with career transitioning, identified development areas and leadership-specific challenges. </li>

                            <li><strong>Talent management:</strong> Leadership development should form a crucial part of your overall talent management. </li>

                        </ul>
