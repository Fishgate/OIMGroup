                    <p>Where people from various cultural or language backgrounds or age, gender and language groups work together, misunderstandings and even conflict can easily arise.</p>  

                    <p>Often the underlying reason for these social tensions is a lack of understanding of other people’s realities, and the prejudices usually associated with this ignorance.</p>

                    <p>This is where OIM can make a difference.</p>

                    <p><strong>With a proven track record in diversity training since the early 80s, we help organisations to create a climate for improved workplace relations by:</strong>
