                <h1>Supervisory Skills</h1>
                <div class='caption'>The critical fit between <strong>supervisory skills</strong> and measurable operational results</div>
                <div class='copy'>
                    <p>It’s a well-known fact that South Africa suffers from a skills shortage. This is a growing concern across several industries and most economists agree that it poses a significant threat to the country’s long-term economic growth.</p> 

                    <p>Middle management and supervisors are among the categories that are most affected. Given the crucial role supervisors play daily as the drivers of sustainable workforce productivity, it is particularly important to equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills to optimally perform their functions.</p>

                    <p><strong>We have designed an intervention that addresses a fundamental weakness in supervisory development – the ability to transfer classroom knowledge to the workplace, resulting in operational improvements.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Our offering</h2>
                    <p>OIM offers a multidisciplinary intervention that will:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Define</strong> what supervisors need to do – an internationally benchmarked framework outlining the required competencies and capabilities.</li> 
                            <li><strong>Assess</strong> supervisors against these competencies to determine the development needs, establish a baseline and track progress. Supervisors undergo a series of pre- and post-assessments while operations solutions consultants conduct regular on-the-floor evaluations.</li> 
                            <li><strong>Develop supervisory skills</strong> through an 80-20 intervention. This is a unique blend of classroom training and assignments (20% focus), complemented by on-the-floor coaching and evaluations (80% focus). This approach bridges the learning transfer gap by ensuring that knowledge is properly applied in the workplace while clients benefit from ongoing operational optimisation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manage talent </strong> through a model that includes recruitment, retention, succession planning and leadership development in your organisation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>You may find programmes that offer these elements in isolation, but few present them as a single intervention led by a multidisciplinary team of specialists with years of experience in performance improvement, process and operational optimisation, and leadership development.</p>

                    <h2>The OIM difference</h2>
                    <p>OIM’s <strong>supervisory skills</strong> offering provides you with:

                            <li>A series of pre- and post-assessments, measuring both psychometrics and operational results.</li>
