                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <div class='copy'>
                    <p>Business performance specialists Operational Improvement Management (OIM) advises several South African blue-chip companies and has managed assignments in Europe, Australia, America and other African countries.</p>

                    <p>With a proven track record dating back to 1985, we specialise in the key areas of people management, organisational improvement and operations management.</p> 

                    <p>Over the years OIM has developed a unique, integrated approach to business performance management and strategy execution in these areas. We believe our model focuses on the main elements of a successful organisation and provides a framework for: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strategy definition</li>
                            <li>Business architecture and alignment</li>
                            <li>Effective leadership and talent management</li>
                            <li>Employee relations and stakeholder engagement</li> 
                            <li>Operations management, optimisation and continuous improvement</li> 
                            <li>Performance measurement and improvement</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Our multidisciplinary team offers seamless implementation of these elements, obviating the need for calling in various business consultants with incompatible methodologies and confusing terminologies.</p> 

                    <p>But don’t take our word for it – <a href="<?php echo $relpath ?>clients">read what our clients have to say</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Sustainability and practicality</h2>

                    <p>Our aim is to make a meaningful contribution to the long-term prosperity of our clients’ organisations as well as the people and communities we interact with.</p> 

                    <p>Accordingly we believe in an integrated model with an emphasis on sustainability. We are not in the business of consultant dependency and ad hoc quick fixes.</p> 

                    <p>Instead we pride ourselves on our ability to simplify complex business concepts, design solutions at boardroom level, implement them throughout the organisation and build internal capacity through the transfer of knowledge and skills.</p>

                    <p>This is why many of our long-standing clients rely on us to help turn their business strategy into a reality.</p>

                    <p>With the successful implementation of our model, OIM has earned a reputation both nationally and internationally for its:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ability to partner with clients and design customised solutions.</li>
                            <li>Practical approach to organisational and operational performance improvement.</li>
                            <li>Ability to create long-term, sustainable business benefits.</li>
                            <li>Delivery method that changes mindsets, develops skillsets and provides toolsets.</li>
                            <li>Integrated model that addresses all key business areas.</li>
                        </ul>
